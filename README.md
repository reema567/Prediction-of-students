## Task 1 Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours using using Linear Regression

This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables. In this regression we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. 
It contains Python Scikit-Learn library for machine learning that can be used to implement regression functions.

## Task 2:- Prediction using Unsupervised ML (Level - Beginner)
